# job_search Python WebScraping LinkedIn
A while back I had applied for a job and was really hoping to get it. I had moved on to the next round for a meet and greet but I was told the job position was being halted at the moment but would reopen in a few months. A few months have already passed but I thought I might as well make a script to scrape for that same job and if it reopens I will get notified to reapply. 

This python script scrapes Linkedin for the Transportation Operations Support Specialist position from Milestone Technologies in Los Angeles and if the job is available then it will send an email to myself stating the job has reopened and a link to the job search.
